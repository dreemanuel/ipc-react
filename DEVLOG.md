# Development Log - IPC React Conversion

## Session 1 - [Current Date]

### Completed Tasks
1. Set up initial React project with Vite
2. Installed core dependencies:
   - react-router-dom
   - sass
   - zustand
3. Set up basic routing in App.tsx
4. Started converting HomePage component:
   - Implemented proper JSX syntax
   - Set up image imports
   - Fixed style attributes

### Lessons Learned
1. React style attributes need to be objects: `style={{ propertyName: "value" }}`
2. Image paths should be imported or use public assets
3. JSX differences from HTML:
   - `class` → `className`
   - `for` → `htmlFor`
   - Self-closing tags need forward slash
   - Style attributes use camelCase

## Session 2 - [Current Date]

### Completed Tasks
1. Broke down HomePage into smaller components:
   - Created sections/ directory with components:
     * Hero (with working image imports)
     * Features (with placeholder FeatureCard)
     * About
     * Testimonials (empty)
     * Products
     * Socials
     * Contact
     * FinalCta (empty)
   - Created ui/ directory with components:
     * FeatureCard (placeholder)
2. Cleaned up App.tsx:
   - Organized routing
   - Added Navbar and Footer components
3. Started component-based architecture implementation

### Areas for Improvement
1. Image Imports:
   - Need to implement proper image imports in:
     * Products component
     * About component
     * Socials component
2. Components to Complete:
   - Testimonials component (empty)
   - FinalCta component (empty)
   - FeatureCard component (needs props implementation)

### Next Steps
1. Font Awesome Integration (choose one):
   - Option A: Install React Font Awesome
     ```bash
     npm i @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons
     ```
   - Option B: Add CDN to index.html
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.4/css/all.min.css">
     ```

2. Component Completion:
   - Implement FeatureCard with props
   - Complete Testimonials component
   - Complete FinalCta component
   - Fix image imports across all components

3. SCSS Migration:
   - Copy SCSS files from original project
   - Update import paths
   - Convert to module.scss if needed
   - Update class names to match new component structure

4. Additional Tasks:
   - Set up Zustand store
   - Implement responsive navigation
   - Add loading states
   - Set up image optimization

### Notes
- Keep NOTES.md for syntax references
- Consider breaking down Products section into ProductCard component
- Plan state management strategy for shopping cart
