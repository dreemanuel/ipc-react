# Development Log - IPC React Conversion

## Session 1 - [Current Date]

### Completed Tasks
1. Set up initial React project with Vite
2. Installed core dependencies:

   - sass
   - zustand
3. Set up basic routing in App.tsx
4. Started converting HomePage component:
   - Implemented proper JSX syntax
   - Set up image imports
   - Fixed style attributes

### Lessons Learned
1. React style attributes need to be objects: `style={{ propertyName: "value" }}`
2. Image paths should be imported or use public assets
3. JSX differences from HTML:
   - `class` → `className`
   - `for` → `htmlFor`
   - Self-closing tags need forward slash
   - Style attributes use camelCase

## Session 2 - [Current Date]
