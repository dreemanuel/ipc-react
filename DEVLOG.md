# Development Log - IPC React Conversion

## Session 1 - [Current Date]

### Completed Tasks
1. Set up initial React project with Vite
2. Installed core dependencies:
   - react-router-dom
   - sass
   - zustand
3. Set up basic routing in App.tsx
4. Started converting HomePage component:
   - Implemented proper JSX syntax
   - Set up image imports
   - Fixed style attributes

### Lessons Learned
1. React style attributes need to be objects: `style={{ propertyName: "value" }}`
2. Image paths should be imported or use public assets
3. JSX differences from HTML:
   - `class` → `className`
   - `for` → `htmlFor`
   - Self-closing tags need forward slash
   - Style attributes use camelCase

## Session 2 - [Current Date]

### Completed Tasks
1. Broke down HomePage into smaller components:
   - Created sections/ directory with components:
     * Hero (with working image imports)
     * Features (with placeholder FeatureCard)
     * About
     * Testimonials (empty)
     * Products
     * Socials
     * Contact
     * FinalCta (empty)
   - Created ui/ directory with components:
     * FeatureCard (placeholder)
2. Cleaned up App.tsx:
   - Organized routing
   - Added Navbar and Footer components
3. Started component-based architecture implementation

### Areas for Improvement
1. Image Imports:
   - Need to implement proper image imports in:
     * Products component
     * About component
     * Socials component
2. Components to Complete:
   - Testimonials component (empty)
   - FinalCta component (empty)
   - FeatureCard component (needs props implementation)

### Next Steps
1. Font Awesome Integration (choose one):
   - Option A: Install React Font Awesome
     ```bash
     npm i @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons
     ```
   - Option B: Add CDN to index.html
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.4/css/all.min.css">
     ```

2. Component Completion:
   - Implement FeatureCard with props
   - Complete Testimonials component
   - Complete FinalCta component
   - Fix image imports across all components

3. SCSS Migration:
   - Copy SCSS files from original project
   - Update import paths
   - Convert to module.scss if needed
   - Update class names to match new component structure

4. Additional Tasks:
   - Set up Zustand store
   - Implement responsive navigation
   - Add loading states
   - Set up image optimization

### Notes
- Keep NOTES.md for syntax references
- Consider breaking down Products section into ProductCard component
- Plan state management strategy for shopping cart

## Session 3 - [Current Date]

### Completed Tasks
1. Set up SCSS compilation workflow
   - Organized SCSS directory structure (base, components, layout, utils)
   - Set up main.scss as the entry point
   - Configured sass watch command
2. Implemented proper routing with react-router-dom
   - Created BtnCtaMain and BtnCtaSecondary components
   - Replaced anchor tags with Link components
   - Set up proper route paths

### Important Note for Assistant
- DO NOT provide direct code solutions unless specifically requested
- Instead, provide hints, explanations, and guidance to help USER implement solutions
- Use NOTES.md to document patterns and solutions for future reference

### Next Tasks
1. Complete Hero Section
   - Add Font Awesome integration for scroll indicator
   - Make slideshow navigation dots interactive
   - Implement automatic slideshow functionality using React hooks

2. Features Section Enhancement
   - Create reusable FeatureCard component
   - Implement dynamic content loading
   - Learn and apply React hooks for interactive elements:
     * useState for managing component state
     * useEffect for side effects
     * Custom hooks for reusable logic

3. React Hooks Deep Dive
   - Study and implement common hook patterns
   - Practice state management with useState
   - Understand component lifecycle with useEffect
   - Create custom hooks for reusable functionality

4. Component Interactivity
   - Add hover effects
   - Implement click handlers
   - Create smooth transitions
   - Add loading states

### Focus Areas
1. React Hooks
   - State management
   - Side effects
   - Custom hooks
   - Conditional rendering

2. Component Architecture
   - Props passing
   - Event handling
   - Dynamic content
   - Reusable components

3. Interactive Elements
   - User feedback
   - Animations
   - State transitions
   - Error handling
